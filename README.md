# Equation Visualizer
This website uses equations to create colorful "graphs" that visualize coordinates' outputs using those colors (this IS NOT a traditional graph, just a cool thing to visualize interesting equations)

All you need to do is type an equation or use the random equation button and it'll automatically be visualized, you can also use the resolution and sensitivity sliders to alter the output:

- Resolution increases the overall quality of the image, but can cause significant lag at high amounts. Lower resolution can also help for seeing infinitely-repeating patterns easier

- Sensitivity affects the range of colors, with higher sensitivities bringing more intense colors. May help to see visualizations better at the cost of worse colors. Default sensitivity is recommended most of the time

### Backgrounds

Along with making cool images of equations, this website can also be used to make backgrounds and wallpapers. Just find a good equation, select a color mode at the bottom of the menu, and then you can download your image as either a png or jpg!
